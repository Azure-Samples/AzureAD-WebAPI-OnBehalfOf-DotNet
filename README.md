# Calling a downstream web API from a web API using Azure AD (archived)

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2/tree/master/2.%20Web%20API%20now%20calls%20Microsoft%20Graph)

 If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-onbehalfof/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
